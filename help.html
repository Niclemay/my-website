<h2>RSI (Relative Strength Index)</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100.</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> Based on the average gains vs losses over the last 14 periods.</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> RSI is below 30–35 (oversold condition).</p>

<h2>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> MACD shows the relationship between two moving averages (usually 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA).</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> MACD = (12-day EMA − 26-day EMA). A 9-day EMA of MACD is the Signal line. The histogram shows the difference between them.</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> MACD line crosses above the Signal line.</p>

<h2>Moving Averages (MA20 & MA50)</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> A moving average smooths price data to identify trends over time.</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> Average of the last N closing prices (20-day and 50-day in this script).</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> Short-term MA (MA20) crosses above long-term MA (MA50).</p>

<h2>Volume</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> Volume measures how many shares/contracts were traded during a period.</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> Compare current volume to the 20-day average volume.</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> Current volume is more than 1.5x the 20-day average (indicating strong confirmation of a move).</p>

<h2>Bollinger Bands</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> Bollinger Bands measure volatility and consist of a middle band (20-day SMA) and two bands above/below (±2 standard deviations).</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> Upper Band = SMA + (2 × Std Dev), Lower Band = SMA − (2 × Std Dev).</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> Price closes below the Lower Band (potential oversold condition).</p>

<h2>ADX (Average Directional Index)</h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> ADX measures the strength of a trend (not its direction).</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> Based on the difference between +DI and −DI lines, smoothed over time.</p>
<p><b>Buy Signal:</b> +DI crosses above −DI AND ADX > 20 (indicating a strong trend).</p>
